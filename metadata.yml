Status: In progress
Title: ChEMBL decoy sampler
Description: This model samples decoy molecules from ChEMBL35 to build negative datasets.
  We look for molecules with low tanimoto similarity (<= 0.3) but similar physicochemical
  characteristics (MW, LogP, HDB, HAB, etc). For each input molecule, the model will
  return up to 100 decoys.
